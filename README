vagrant-centos
==============

Scripts to create a lean CentOS Vagrant box.

Run:

  ./setup

and at the boot prompt press tab to gain access to the boot options.
Add the `ks=.*` string you get from the command prompt. The rest of
the installation is automated.

Finally, run the last command that `setup` spits out (it's of the
form `./cleanup && ...`). Congratulations! You have just created a
Vagrant box.


Specification
-------------

The box is constrained to 613 MiB of memory to vaguely resemble an
Amazon AWS micro instance. You may want to consider adjusting this
for your needs using options like:

    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", 2048]
        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--ioapic", "on", "--cpus", 2]
    end

in your `Vagrantfile`.

This box has a heavy bias towards US English locales. If this
affects you, please adjust the `ks.cfg` file accordingly. This was
mainly done as a space saving measure.


Additional Notes
----------------

There is a hacky 'web server' to get the kickstart script into the
installer which requires a recent `netcat` version. Alternatively,
you could host the `ks.cfg` file on your own HTTP server.

Be aware that this build will *not* bake in any special provisioners
(e.g. puppet, chef, etc.). Of course, shell scripting is still
available or you can modify kickstart file to include your favourite
provisioner.

The development tools group package is also included for
convenience. This includes things like `gcc`, `make`, etc.

You are encouraged to look at the top of `setup` to modify the
configuration to best suit your needs. In particular, take note
of the location of the ISOs (which aren't include in the git
repository):

  INSTALLER="./isos/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso"
  GUESTADDITIONS="./isos/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso"

Assumptions have been made about the location of the hard drive as
well:

  HDD="${HOME}/VirtualBox VMs/${NAME}/${NAME}.vmdk"
