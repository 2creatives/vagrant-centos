vagrant-centos
==============

Scripts to create a lean CentOS Vagrant box.

Run:

    ./box initialize

and at the boot prompt press tab to gain access to the boot options.
Add the `ks=.*` string you get from the command prompt. The rest of
the installation is automated.

Finally, run the last command that the initialize step spits out
(it's of the form `./box cleanup && ...`). Congratulations! You have
just created a Vagrant box.


Specification
-------------

The box is constrained to 613 MiB of memory to vaguely resemble an
Amazon AWS micro instance. You may want to consider adjusting this
for your needs using options like:

    config.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |vb|
        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", 2048]
        vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--ioapic", "on", "--cpus", 2]
    end

in your `Vagrantfile`.

This box has a heavy bias towards US English locales. If this
affects you, please adjust the `ks.cfg` file accordingly. This was
mainly done as a space saving measure.


Additional Notes
----------------

A simple Ruby-based webserver has been provided in order to
bootstrap the process. Alternatively, you could host the `ks.cfg`
file on your own HTTP server.

Please be aware that these scripts will *not* install any special
provisioners beyond the shell. Patches will be considered if you
wish to contribute support for Puppet, Chef, etc.

The development tools group package is also included for
convenience. This includes things like `gcc` and `make` as well as
VCSs like `git`, `hg`, `bzr`, etc.

You are encouraged to look at the file `vars.sh` to modify the
configuration to best suit your needs. In particular, take note
of the location of the ISOs (which aren't include in the git
repository):

    INSTALLER="./isos/CentOS-6.5-x86_64-minimal.iso"
    GUESTADDITIONS="./isos/VBoxGuestAdditions_4.3.14.iso"

Assumptions have been made about the location of the hard drive as
well:

    HDD="${HOME}/VirtualBox VMs/${NAME}/${NAME}.vmdk"

If you wished to be emailed with the various logs the build produces
see the `ks.cfg` file and find the line:

    EMAIL=root

and adjust accordingly.
