vagrant-centos
==============

Scripts to create a lean CentOS Vagrant box.

Run:

  ./setup

and follow the instructions. There is a hacky 'web server' to get the
kickstart script into the installer which requires a recent `netcat`
version. Alternatively, you could host the `ks.cfg` file on your own
HTTP server.

Be aware that this build will *not* bake in any provisioners
(e.g. puppet, chef, etc.). You will need to decide how you wish to
provision your boxes.

You are encouraged to look at the top of `setup` to modify the
configuration to best suit your needs. In particular, take note of the
location of the ISOs (which aren't apart of the source):

  INSTALLER="./isos/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso"
  GUESTADDITIONS="./isos/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso"

Assumptions have been made about the location of the hard drive as well:

  HDD="${HOME}/VirtualBox VMs/${NAME}/${NAME}.vmdk"
