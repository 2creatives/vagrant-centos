vagrant-centos
==============

Scripts to create a lean CentOS Vagrant box.

Run:

  ./setup

and at the boot prompt press tab to gain access to the boot options. Add the
ks=.* string you get from the command prompt. The rest of the installation is
automated, however, you will have to intervene to shutdown the machine at the
end. You will know when this moment is when you are presented with a login
prompt. Just type in:

  username: root
  password: vagrant

and type `poweroff`. Run the last command that `setup` spits out (of the form
`./cleanup && ...`). Congratulations! You have just created a Vagrant box.


Notes
-----

There is a hacky 'web server' to get the kickstart script into the installer
which requires a recent `netcat` version. Alternatively, you could host the
`ks.cfg` file on your own HTTP server.

Be aware that this build will *not* bake in any provisioners (e.g. puppet,
chef, etc.). You will need to decide how you wish to provision your boxes.

You are encouraged to look at the top of `setup` to modify the configuration
to best suit your needs. In particular, take note of the location of the ISOs
(which aren't apart of the source):

  INSTALLER="./isos/CentOS-6.4-x86_64-minimal.iso"
  GUESTADDITIONS="./isos/VBoxGuestAdditions.iso"

Assumptions have been made about the location of the hard drive as well:

  HDD="${HOME}/VirtualBox VMs/${NAME}/${NAME}.vmdk"
